# Python tech test #

## Objective ##

A company mandate has specified that all development teams must migrate to gp3 volumes across the account, as part of a cost saving measure.

The platform team would like to monitor this rollout, and in this case a brief script has been chosen as the data gathering tool

OPTION (python / bash)

## python
- Using the boilerplate provided, add in the necessary code to return a list of volumes (do not worry about pagination), then print to console any volume ids that are still utilising gp2 or below architecture. (feel free to use the internet to help)

## bash
- Using the AWS CLI and your choice of json parsing (awscli jsonpath or jq recommended), perform the necessary command to print to console any volume ids in the account that are utilising gp2 or below architecture. (feel free to use the internet to help)

## Notes ##

- If candidate has alternative cloud experience to AWS in python option, add the boto response line and instead test just on the data traversal component.
