## Objective ##

You are writing a simple piece of code to compose multiple types of things that can speak. The aim is to define some behaviour on a reusable Speaker interface, and then extend Person to satisfy this interface and utilise methods defined on it.

1. Define the Speaker interface, it needs to by usable by the GreetWithPhrase func.
2. Extend the Person struct to satisfy the Speaker interface (Speak can just print out a given phrase to the console)
3. Create a new function that acts on the speakable interface

4. Extend Person & Speaker to store and have a way to return the speakers name. Then create a new function that acts on Speaker to say the speakers name.
